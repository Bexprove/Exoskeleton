# 🚀 Exoskeleton Design - Hackathon Project  

## 🏆 Hackathon Winner: Enhancing Miner Safety  
This project was developed as part of a hackathon focused on designing a **robotic exoskeleton** aimed at **reducing fatigue and improving safety for miners**. Our design integrated **biomechanical support, real-time load distribution, and an assistive movement system** to help workers with high-impact tasks.

## 🔹 Key Features  
- **Biomechanical Assistance** – Provides structural support for lower limbs.  
- **Load Distribution System** – Distributes weight evenly to reduce stress on joints.  
- **Battery-Powered Actuators** – Enhances movement efficiency with assistive motion.  
- **Adaptive Control Mechanism** – Embedded sensors for dynamic adjustment based on movement.  

## 🔹 Design Process  
1. **Concept Development** – Brainstorming ideas, evaluating feasibility.  
2. **Sketching & CAD Modeling** – Creating initial hand-drawn sketches and CAD models.  
3. **Material Selection** – Choosing lightweight, durable materials for high efficiency.  
4. **Simulation & Testing** – Evaluating performance through computational simulations.  

## 🔹 Technical Analysis and Equations  
The mechanical structure of the exoskeleton is modeled using fundamental biomechanical equations:

**Newton's Second Law of Motion:**
```
F = ma
```
Where:
- `F` represents force applied by the actuator.
- `m` is the mass of the load.
- `a` is acceleration.

**Torque Calculation:**
```
τ = r × F
```
Where:
- `τ` is the torque exerted at the joints.
- `r` is the distance from the pivot.
- `F` is the applied force.

These equations govern motion stability and load distribution, ensuring effective force management within the exoskeleton system.

## 🔹 Repository Structure  
- `Papers/` – Contains handwritten notes, design sketches, and technical documents.  
- `CAD/` – Contains the Design Files.    

## 📂 Additional Files
